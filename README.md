## Privacy

Handy Dictionary does not collect, store, or do anything else with any personal user information. To Free Dictionary API it sends only the word or phrase selected for definition and a language key (such as "en" for English).

It is free to use. It is not a platform for advertising. It is not a business nor is it part of any business plan. It's just a simple bit of open-source software.

## Future plans

Items planned include:
- integrating a translation API
- adding additional languages to the user interface
- color themes

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Especially welcome would be help extending the UI to additional languages.
